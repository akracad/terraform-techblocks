AWS Infrastructure Deployment Tasks

1. Network Infrastructure Setup
Create a VPC with custom CIDR blocks.

Create public and private subnets across multiple availability zones.

Set up an Internet Gateway and route tables for internet access.

Configure a NAT Gateway for private subnet access to the internet.

Implement Security Groups for EC2 instance access control.

Set up Network ACLs for subnet-level traffic control.

2. EC2 Instance Setup & Sample Application Deployment
Launch EC2 instances (using Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).

Install a sample application on the EC2 instance (e.g., a Node.js app or a simple web server).

Configure user data scripts to automate app installation on EC2.

Ensure security group allows necessary traffic (HTTP, SSH).

3. Load Balancer Setup
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across EC2 instances.

Set up target groups to register EC2 instances with the load balancer.

Configure listeners for the ALB to handle incoming HTTP traffic.

4. Auto Scaling Configuration
Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for EC2 instances to handle traffic scaling.

Define launch configurations for EC2 instances in the auto scaling group.

Set desired, minimum, and maximum instance counts for auto scaling.

Attach the ASG instances to the load balancer target group.

5. Monitoring & Alerts
Set up CloudWatch monitoring to track EC2 and load balancer health.

Configure CloudWatch alarms for high CPU usage (e.g., trigger when CPU usage > 80%).

Set up SNS notifications to send alerts (via email/SMS) when alarms are triggered.

Enable basic CloudWatch monitoring for EC2 instances.

6. Backup Strategy Implementation
Implement EBS snapshots for backup of EC2 volumes.

Automate AMI backups for EC2 instance state.
