In Terraform, dependencies between resources can be classified into two types: **implicit** and **explicit**. Both define the order in which resources are created or modified, but they are established in different ways.

### 1. **Implicit Dependencies**

Implicit dependencies are automatically created by Terraform when one resource refers to another in its configuration. Terraform understands that one resource depends on another and will automatically manage the order of creation or modification based on these relationships.

For example, if you have a resource that references the output of another resource, Terraform will implicitly understand that the second resource needs to be created before the first. This is usually done through references to attributes of other resources.

#### Example of Implicit Dependency:
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.example.id  # Implicit dependency
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
```

In the above example:
- The `aws_subnet.example` resource implicitly depends on the `aws_vpc.example` resource because it references `aws_vpc.example.id`.
- Terraform will ensure that the VPC is created first before the subnet because the subnet depends on the VPC's ID.

### 2. **Explicit Dependencies**

Explicit dependencies are defined using the `depends_on` argument. This is used when you want to enforce a specific creation order, even if Terraform does not naturally deduce it from resource references. This is useful when resources might not directly reference each other but still need to be created or modified in a certain order.

#### Example of Explicit Dependency:
```hcl

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_security_group.example]  # Explicit dependency
}
```

In this example:
- The `aws_instance.example` resource explicitly depends on the `aws_security_group.example` resource.
- The `depends_on` argument ensures that the security group is created before the EC2 instance, regardless of whether there is an implicit dependency between them.

### Summary of Key Differences:
- **Implicit Dependencies:** These are automatically inferred by Terraform when one resource references the attributes of another.
- **Explicit Dependencies:** These are manually defined by the user using the `depends_on` argument when you need to enforce a creation order that is not naturally inferred from resource references.

In general, **implicit dependencies** should be used wherever possible, as Terraform can automatically determine the correct resource creation order. **Explicit dependencies** are used when you need to force a particular order of resource creation, even if Terraform doesn't automatically infer it.
