Automate Infra using Terraform on GCP

1. Network Infrastructure Setup
Create a VPC with custom CIDR blocks.

Create public and private subnets in different regions.

Set up firewall rules for controlling ingress and egress traffic.

Configure Cloud NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access.

Set up VPC Peering (if needed for communication with other VPCs).

2. Compute Engine Setup & Sample Application Deployment
Launch VM instances using a suitable image (e.g., Debian or Ubuntu).

Install a sample application (e.g., Apache, Node.js, or NGINX) on the VMs.

Use startup scripts for automatic application deployment when the VM starts.

Configure firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS and SSH access.

3. Load Balancer Setup
Set up a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer to distribute traffic across VMs.

Create backend services and associate them with the load balancer.

Set up URL maps to route traffic based on request patterns.

Configure health checks for VMs to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy instances.

4. Auto Scaling Configuration
Set up an Instance Group with an autoscaler to automatically scale the number of VMs based on CPU utilization or other metrics.

Configure the autoscaling policy (e.g., scale out when CPU > 70% for 5 minutes).

Ensure that new instances are registered with the load balancer.

5. Monitoring & Alerts
Set up Google Cloud Monitoring to track VM health, load balancer metrics, and instance performance.

Create alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring for high CPU or low VM health.

Set up email/SMS notifications via Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions for alerting.

Configure Stackdriver logging to capture logs for troubleshooting.

6. Backup Strategy Implementation
Configure snapshot schedules for VM persistent disks.

Set up Cloud Storage for backup of application data or logs.

Implement disk encryption and ensure backups are securely stored.
